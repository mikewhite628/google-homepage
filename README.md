For my first project I created a non functional clone of the google homepage to get some experience working with HTML and CSS.

While the styling isnt 100% perfect i feel like its pretty close. I used CCS grid for the main layout of the page and then flex for the header and footer.

In the future when I'm a little more comfortable with scalability I'd like to come back and make it page collapse a little better at smaller sizes.

All in all the project was a blast!
